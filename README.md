## Files:
- single_threaded_CPU.cpp - implementation of sequential programming without any parallelization


- CPUprogramming.cpp - implementation of both single thread and multiple threads using CBLAS with timing. Error is calculated on results from multi-threaded way.
  To complie, using command 
  ```
  g++ -o CPUprogramming CPUprogramming.cpp -lopenblas -O3
  ```
  To run, use command
  ```
  ./CPUprogramming
  ```
